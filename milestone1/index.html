        <h2>Website Summary:</h2>
        <h4>What content will the site contain?</h4>
        <p>This site will contain information about
            my mom's haircut business. It will have things
            like prices and hours. It will also have what
            what types of haircuts she can do. And it will 
            her contact information to set up an appointment. </p>
        <h4>Where will you get all of the content for your site (ie. images & text)?</h4>
        <p>Most of the information on the site will come directly from my mom.
            I will use her pictures that she has taken of her clients.
        </p>
        <h4>Why should users care about the focus of the site?</h4>
        <p>To get information about when and where they can get a haircut,
            as well as how much it will cost and what type of haircut they
            can get.
        </p>
        <h4>Why should a site be built for this?</h4>
        <p>It will be an extra path of traffic for my mom's business, and clients
            won't have to call her everytime they have a question hopefully.
        </p>
        <h4>What would you like users to do at your site?</h4>
        <p>I would like users to check and see what days and times are available
            for a haircut, also check prices and decide on what haircut they want,
            then contact my mom from the website.
        </p>
        <h4>What is the goal of the site?</h4>
        <p>The goal is to give users information about the business and get them to 
            contact my mom through the site.
